# pokemon
This React-based project implements a Pokémon card game using modular components. The Pokecard component renders individual Pokémon data, fetching images from an API. Pokegame manages the core game logic, randomly distributing Pokémon into two hands. Pokedex displays collections of Pokecards and determines the winning hand based on total experience points. The implementation leverages React's component architecture, uses props for data flow, and employs JavaScript array methods for game mechanics. CSS Flexbox is utilized for responsive card layouts. The codebase showcases practical application of React patterns and modern JavaScript features in building an interactive web application, with potential for future enhancements in state management or API integration.
